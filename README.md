# list-dictionary-array-loops
This is a mix of programs I have made during my program.

m1p4.py is a script that will take element from a list and sort them in 2 different lists. Then it will print it in a table. The second part will split the string and only take the username in it and print it using prettytable instead.
lopp1.py is a simple loop program that uses for and while differently.
keylist.py is a list program that sort and print the elements in columns.
dict.py uses 2 different methods to print a dictionary: one manually and one with prettytable. It also uses ipaddress to find the subnet.
arraysum.py uses a list and a target number. The script goes through the list and try and find 2 values that summed equal the target number.
